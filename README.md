# Treehouse-Portfolio-Updated
Treehouse Project 1 - Updated

This project involved editing a personal profile page that Treehouse provided.  I wrote new text, adapted the HTML and CSS a bit, and
added a photo page.  The profile photo and the images on the photo page are mine; the others come from Pixabay.
