        <p>I grew up in Hanover County, which is just north of Richmond, Virginia.  I majored in English at the University of Richmond, and after working a few years as a preschool teacher's assistant and in the business world, I went back and got a doctorate in English at the University of North Carolina.  I have always loved learning, and studying for a PhD is also a kind of education in how to teach yourself complicated material.  The <em>curiosity</em> that powered my long days studying literature now fuels my interest in coding.</p>
        <p>Beyond encouraging my inner autodidact, graduate school prepared me for coding in multiple ways.  I taught (mostly composition, with a couple of literature classes) for twelve semesters.  I learned from my students, and what I learned had a lot to do with understanding the <em>user experience</em> of my courses.  In other words, how was the course material experienced from the student (or user) side?  What additional materials or accompanying instruction or extra explanation would make this content most comprehendable and memorable?  Teaching required me to think about how my students used the materials I provided them; teaching well demanded attention to how my students best learned in my classes.  This gives me some tangentially-related experience in thinking about how users will experience websites I design.</p>
        <p>Graduate school also demanded, and taught, <em>tenaciousness</em> and <em>self-direction</em>.  As a PhD student, once you are done with classes and exams, your job involves setting yourself problems to solve, and then solving them on your own.  You devise a research question or questions, and then you teach yourself how to answer them.  Usually the answers aren't perfectly obvious from the start, because if they were, that wouldn't be a particularly interesting set of research questions.  Advisors guide you and certain texts serve as beacons, but the process depends on you.  That requires a tremendous amount of personal stick-to-itiveness.  Coding, which often involves individual work problem solving with the aid of various online written resources, can be like graduate study that way.</p>
        <p>Finally, graduate school taught me how to <em>cooperate</em> in a professional setting.  I often collaborated with other teachers to design units and lessons, sometimes implementing them together as well.  The collaboration involved alternating between individual work on my own lessons, my components of shared lessons, and my own teaching, and cooperative work conceptualizing, inventing, and planning with other graduate student teachers.  Although I have yet to work on a web design team, it seems like that work also requires alternating between group work and individual work as a project moves to completion.  I work well on my own, but I also really like imagining new possibilities in teams, and I enjoy contributing to a larger project.</p>
